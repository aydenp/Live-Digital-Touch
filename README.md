# Live Digital Touch

Bringing back the pre-watchOS 3 Digital Touch.

Prior to watchOS 3/iOS 10, Digital Touch was live. You drew something and your partner immediately saw it. In iOS 10, it was now iMessage-based, making the experience less personal.

This app attempts to mimic the pre-watchOS 3 experience on iOS.

## How does it work?

This app uses Game Center to connect to a peer, and then the private Digital Touch API in iOS to display the Digital Touch output from both you and the partner.
