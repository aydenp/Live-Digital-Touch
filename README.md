# Live Digital Touch

Bringing back the pre-watchOS 3 Digital Touch experience.

Prior to watchOS 3/iOS 10, Digital Touch was live. You drew something and your partner immediately saw it. In iOS 10, it was now iMessage-based, making the experience less personal.

This app attempts to mimic the pre-watchOS 3 experience on iOS.

This is more of an experiment than a real project intended to be released, so don't expect your issues to actually be fixed in a timely manner (or even at all). Instead, try making a fork and seeing where it can take you (read Contributing)!

## How does it work?

This app uses Game Center to connect to a peer, and then the private Digital Touch API in iOS to display the Digital Touch output from both you and the partner.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the source code of Live Digital Touch to make it something even better! Just try to adhere to the general coding style throughout, to make it as readable as possible.
